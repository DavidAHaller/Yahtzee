PSU's SWENG 500: Advanced Software Engineering Studio project for Team Six.

# Lessons

Lesson 2
The goal for this week is to develop the SRS (Software Requirements Specification) document and write initial test cases.

Lesson 3
From the use cases you have created you should now create the domain model (refer back to lesson 3 of SWENG 537) and from that create the class diagram (refer back to lesson 4 of SWENG 537). As you develop the class diagram make sure it is consistent with the domain model. Please pay special attention to object creation, attribute modification, and association formation.

Lesson 4
Next week you will be demonstrating one end-to-end scenario of your project. It is essentially executing the shell of your application. Since you will begin coding to create the end-to-end scenario it is time to begin XUnit testing which is the family of testing frameworks built to support TDD. XUnit includes JUnit for Java, CPPUnit for C++, PyUnit for Python, NUnit for C# etc.

Lesson 5
As you continue your project, the end-to-end scenario is due at your instructor meeting this week. Keep up with the unit testing and updating the project artifacts as necessary.

Lesson 6
This week XUnit fail reports are due for the first main set of functionality. The first main set of functionality is due at the team’s instructor meeting during week 7. It is critical at the scheduled team meeting with the instructor to share the teams progress thus far. We can continue to use the task sheet format but at this point it would be effective to include some other elements to the task sheet regarding the progress of the project. In general, progress reports are written to inform the customer about progress you've made on a project over a certain period of time. Progress reports are written typically for projects that span more than several months or ones that are time critical (such as this one!).

Lesson 7
The first set of functionality as well as XUnit pass reports for this functionality is due this week. Please also update the project artifacts as necessary.

Lesson 8
This week XUnit fail reports for the second set of functionality and the task sheet are due.

Lesson 9
The second set of functionality as well as XUnit pass reports for this functionality is due this week. Please also update the project artifacts as necessary.

Lesson 10
This week XUnit fail reports for the third set of functionality and the task sheet are due.

Lesson 11
The third set of functionality as well as XUnit pass reports for this functionality is due this week. Please also update the project artifacts as necessary.

Lesson 12
This week any remaining XUnit fail reports and the task sheet are due.

Lesson 13
This week your team is wrapping up any final functionality of your project. The final SRS is due this week as well as the final class diagram. You may continue to update the test document as the final test reports are due week 14.

In addition to the final test reports and final demo of the project, your final report is also due next week. It would be a good idea to begin outlining your team’s final group report document. Please see the linked example of the group report. It is not a lengthy document – max 5 pages. The main point of this document is to discuss how your project plan was executed and the lesson learned from that plan. Please use the format provided in the example.

Lesson 14: Group Project Report and Peer Review
The final group report, final test document and peer review which includes a self review are due Sunday, August 16 by 11:55 PM (EST). Lesson 13 discussed the specifications and linked an example of this Group Project Report. Below are the specifications for the Peer Evaluation.
